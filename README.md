# Notes on GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data.

GraphQL is created by defined types and fields, then providing functions for each field:

```
type Query {
  me: User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
}

function Query_me(request) {
  return request.auth.user;
}

function User_name(user) {
  return user.getName();
}
```

A GraphQL service is running on a URL it can receive queries to validate and execute by calling the provided functions to produce a result.

At is simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects, the query has the same shape of the result.

> GraphQL queries can traverse related objects and their fields, letting clients fetch lots of related data in one request, instead of making several roundtrips as one would need in a classic REST architecture.

GraphQL queries look the same for both single items or lists of items; however, we know which one to expect based on what is indicated in the schema.


## Arguments

In GraphQL, every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches.

Arguments can be of many different types.

GraphQL server can also declare its own custom types, as long as they can be serialized into your transport format.

```
{
  human(id: "1000") {
    name
    height
  }
}

{
  "data": {
    "human": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker",
      "height": 1.72
    }
  }
}
```

## Aliases

The result object fields match the name of the field in the query but don't include arguments, you can't directly query for the same field with different arguments. 

Are used to avoid conflicts as we can rename the results.

```
{
  empireHero: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
    name
  }
  jediHero: hero(episode: JEDI) {
    name
  }
}
{
  "data": {
    "empireHero": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker"
    },
    "jediHero": {
      "name": "R2-D2"
    }
  }
}

```

## Fragments

Fragment are reusable units. A fragment let me create a set of fields to include theme in queries.

Fragments are frequently used to split complicated application data requirements into smaller chunks, especially when you need to combine lots of UI components with different fragments into one initial data fetch.

It is possible for fragments to access variables declared in the query or mutation.
